in the beginning
    - the struggle
        - one computer (old dev server, one install)
        - second computer (new dev server)
        - third computer
        - fourth computer
        - development VMs
    - the first solution
        - subversion
        - svn import
        - svn checkout
        - small script to automate installation
        - euphoria
    - good
        - Able to share between hosts
        - used for a whole year
    - bad
        - subversion is clunky, not easy to branch
        - no way to check out on web hosts or at home

# brave new world

## something better
    - switch to git
    - access on more machines

    - let's see if anyone else has solved this problem
        - common MO is to clone and "install" by symlinking
            - shell script (ew)
            - makefile (double ew)
            - ruby (meh, it's nifty but not ubiquitous)

## requirements
    - quick to install
    - install dotfiles anywhere
    - as few software requirements as possible
        - git
        - perl


# let's try it out

## getting started
    - clone git@github.com:justone/dotfiles.git
    - push to your own repository, github or otherwise

## installation
    - git clone your_repo
    - ./.dotfiles/bin/dfm
    - now dfm is on your path

## changing a file
    - dfm add .vimrc
    - dfm ci -m 'added super cool mapping'
    - dfm push origin master

## getting latest dotfiles
    - dfm updates
    - dfm mergeandinstall

# special features

## arbitrary git commands
## recursion
## backups
## even has tests
## advanced branching

# documentation

## pod doc
## wiki
    - cookbook
    - full documentation
    - FAQs, eventually

# looking forward
